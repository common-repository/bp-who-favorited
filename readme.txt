A plugin to show users who have favorited a BuddyPress activity. 

== Description ==
BuddyPress is a great plugin to create a community website. Users get engaged by adding various updates, comments, and replies. It provides the capability to favorite an activity. If you like the update you can favorite it and it will be added to my favorites section. But, BuddyPress does not provide any direct method to show them how many favorites you activity has received. This plugin is built to show the total number of favorites count in a beautiful way. By default, it will show three avatars of the recently favorited user and the total count of favorites.
